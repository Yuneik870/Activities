// ? TO DO: create a while loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100 by following these steps...
// 1) create a variable to represent the current number

let num = 100;

// 2) create a variable to represent the current total

let total = 0;

// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100while

let i = 1;
while (i <= num) {
    total += i;
    console.log(total);
    i++;
}
